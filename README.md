 🚍 Transport Tracker

A real-time **Transport Tracking System** built to monitor and track the live location of public or private transport vehicles such as buses, vans, or school transports. This system helps passengers or guardians to stay informed about arrival times, current location, and delays using GPS and IoT integration.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **GPS Module** constantly reads the location and sends it to the cloud/server.
2. **Backend** processes location data and calculates ETA/delays.
3. **Frontend App** fetches live data and displays it on a map.
4. **Users** can check transport location, estimated time, and get alerts.
